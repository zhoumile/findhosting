<p>There was a time when there were only a few web hosting providers. Then, it was very easier to pick one, as it didnâ€™t cause much confusion either. Now, we have so many web hosts out there and random selection is out of the scenes! Nevertheless, Bluehost Hosting is one of the rarer web hosting providers that have been in the top position of the list â€” regardless the time. For more than a decade, it has been the favorite choice of professionals and the company built a sustainable reputation too. Regardless these stuff; you may be concerned about the current scenario with Bluehost Hosting. In this Bluehost review, we will go deep into Bluehost Hosting Services. We can discuss the services offered in each section, pricing, reliability, performance and whatnot.</p>
<p><amp-img class="size-full wp-image-588 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluehost-Review.jpg" alt="Bluehost Review" width="700" height="440" srcset="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluehost-Review.jpg 700w, http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Bluehost-Review-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"></amp-img></p>
<h2 itemprop="alternativeHeadline">Bluehost â€” a Historical Overview</h2>
<p>When Matt Heaton started Bluehost back in 1996, it was indeed a small company. Nevertheless, in such a short span of less than 2 decades, Bluehost became the industry leader. It was one of the reasons why Endurance International Group â€”commonly called EIG â€” acquired Bluehost in 2011. Currently, Bluehost is owned by EIG, which also happens to be the owner of HostGator, iPage and several other web hosts.</p>
<p>In the course of time, Bluehost has adapted to all those demands in the industry. The biggest example can be seen in the availability of offered products. Before a few years, Bluehost was offering only shared web hosting services. Now, however, it has started providing different kinds of hosting services. According to the statistics published by the firm itself, <strong>more than 1.9 Million domain names</strong> depend on Bluehost for hosting purposes.</p>
<h2>Services Offered by Bluehost Hosting and Pricing Structures</h2>
<p>Now, in this Bluehost review, we shall have a look on the different hosting packages you get from Bluehost. We will also go deep into the pricing structure of individual plans.</p>
<h3>Shared Web Hosting</h3>
<p>Shared Web Hosting is one of the most-used services from Bluehost. Itâ€™s noted for the availability of a free domain, an affordable pricing package and state-of-the-art hardware. On top of all these, Bluehost has an easier control panel to help the newbies. The pricing plans of Bluehost Shared Hosting package are as follows.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Basic plan</strong> of Bluehost shared hosting will cost you $3.49 per month. You can host single website and will get a storage space of 50GB. The plan offers unlimited bandwidth and 5 Email accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Plus</strong> is the second plan in shared web hosting category of Bluehost. It costs $5.95 and unlimited domains can be hosted in the account. In addition, you are provided with unmetered storage space and bandwidth. Youâ€™d have marketing offers worth $200 and one license of SpamExperts.</li>
<li><strong>Business Pro</strong> is the most advanced package in this range of shared hosting. Although you have to pay $13.95 each month, you get unlimited resources, such as bandwidth and storage space. And Bluehost gives you High-Performance servers instead of standard ones. You can also have 1 dedicated IP, domain privacy and SSL.</li>
</ul><p><amp-img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bluehost-plans.png" alt="Bluehost Plans" width="866" height="736" srcset="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bluehost-plans.png 866w, http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bluehost-plans-300x255.png 300w, http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bluehost-plans-768x653.png 768w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"></amp-img></p>
<h3>Bluehost VPS Hosting</h3>
<p>VPS Hosting is another expert area of Bluehost. Since Bluehost itself is creating the required servers, its performance will never be compromised. In addition, being powered by CentOS and enhanced cPanel, users find it easy to use VPS from Bluehost. Four VPS plans are there in Bluehost â€” Standard, Enhanced, Premium and Ultimate plans. The basic plan costs $14.99 whereas the Ultimate plan is available for $59.99 for the first month. Obviously, availability of CPU and RAM do vary depending on the plans you take.</p>
<h3>Bluehost Dedicated Server Hosting</h3>
<p>With these plans, you can lease out fully-fledged web server machines. Servers are built and maintained by Bluehost, with maximum care for performance and sustainability. Of course, thanks to the CentOS, cPanel Enhanced and that managed behavior, Bluehost Servers do the best. It has three plans â€” Standard, Enhanced and Premium â€” priced at $74.99 per month to $124.99 per month respectively. See more details about Bluehost dedicated servers <a href="../../bluehost-dedicated-hosting-services-review/index.html">in this post</a>.</p>
<h3>Bluehost WordPress Hosting</h3>
<p><a href="../../bluehost-wordpress-hosting/index.html">Bluehost WordPress Hosting</a> is the managed WordPress package you can have. Itâ€™s one of the most affordable hosts you can go for WordPress-oriented hosting. Its four different plans in the package â€” Blogger, Professional, Business and Enterprise. They are respectively priced at $12.49, $37.50, $60.00 and $85.00. The Blogger plan offers 30GB of storage, 2GB RAM and 5 ManageWP sites. You can use the plan to manage up to 100 Million visits per month.</p>
<h3>Bluehost Cloud Sites</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s Bluehostâ€™s name for cloud-based websites. <a href="../../review-bluehost-cloud-hosting/index.html">Starter, Performance and Business Pro</a> are its plans, priced at monthly rates of $5.95, $8.95 and $15.95 respectively. In all the plans, you get unmetered bandwidth. In the basic, there are limitations on the number of sites you can host. You also get SpamExperts and dedicated IP address etc as you go for the higher plans of Bluehost Cloud Sites.</p>
<p>So, now, you should have an outline about the pricing structure of Bluehost hosting services. Now, itâ€™s time to check out other areas in our Bluehost Review.</p>
<h2>Uptime, Speed &amp; Performance</h2>
<p>It does not matter the type of service you go for, Bluehost offers an uptime of 99.99%. Obviously, it doesnâ€™t give you 100% uptime, due to several reasons. However, the claim of 99.99% is accurate according to the statistics. Even after the observation of a few years, sites hosted on Bluehost managed to be functioning almost all the time. So, let that be a VPS or shared hosting or dedicated servers, you donâ€™t need to be worried about uptime. And, things are easier if you are using Bluehost Cloud Sites.</p>
<p>When it comes to the case of speed and performance, thereâ€™s something unique about Bluehost. When compared to the other web hosts around, Bluehost servers seem quite well-performing and consistent. The reason is that servers of Bluehost are built and maintained by Bluehost itself. So, they have better control over optimizations in hardware aspect of everything. And, to keep things simple, Bluehost makes use of customized versions of OS and other front-end software. For instance, youâ€™d find CentOS in dedicated servers and VPSs, which is user-friendly and performance oriented.</p>
<p>In addition to these, Bluehost offers an additional Content Delivery Network as well. You need to pay for the service, but itâ€™s surely worth the shot. By the way, enhanced performance is a surety if you are to consider the CMS-focused packages like WordPress Managed Hosting and WooCommerce Hosting.</p>
<h2>Security Aspect of Services</h2>
<p>There isnâ€™t anything much premium about Bluehost Hosting security. Itâ€™s just like Bluehost offers standard protection for almost all the services, let that be your shared server or VPS. Nevertheless, youâ€™ve an option to enhance the intensity of protection by purchasing Bluehostâ€™s SiteLock. Itâ€™s a premium service that should cost you something per year. Itâ€™s useful when you want extra detection power and protection.</p>
<h2>Server Setup andÂ Usability</h2>
<p>When compared to other web hosts, itâ€™s easier to set up your server in Bluehost. Instant Provisioning is everywhere in all the plans. Itâ€™s amazing to know that Bluehost can get your dedicated servers ready in a few seconds instead of a few hours. As we said before, they are using a customer-friendly OS in the dedicated solutions. So, regardless your expertise, youâ€™ll get used to it no time. At the same time, CentOS is truly customizable from the advanced user point of view.</p>
<p>Talking about usability, Bluehost makes use of enhanced cPanel for almost every type of products. It can be seen in your shared hosting interface as well as the fully-fledged Virtual Private Server. Bluehost cPanel is a bit different than the actual cPanel. Here, you would have a minimalistic interface that doesnâ€™t require much time to educate you. You can get started with the hosting in no time. Also, if we consider the case of WordPress Managed Hosting, you get a set of WordPress-centric controls as well. In short, we give full marks for the usability aspect of Bluehost products.</p>
<h2>Technical Support or Customer Support</h2>
<p>Customer Support is an area where Bluehost really excels! Even now, Bluehost is the industry leader if you are going to judge by the way of treating customers. There are two ways â€” Live Chat and Telephone â€” to reach customer care of Bluehost services. Bluehost has enriched its customer care with the same experts who know servers very well. In fact, these support executives are working close to the engineers who build and manage Bluehost servers. Because of these reasons, Bluehost support always gets the job done and users are quite satisfied too. Once again, itâ€™s scoring high in our Bluehost Review.</p>
<h2>Notable Alternatives to Bluehost</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with what we saw above in the Bluehost review, you may need some alternatives. Among the huge list, there are some cool Bluehost alternatives you can go for. They are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>HostGator</strong> is also owned by Endurance International Group, but is a bit different from Bluehost. First of all, it offers a bit more affordable pricing plans for hosting and there isnâ€™t this touch of minimalism. For instance, you will be having a fully-fledged cPanel with enhanced options. So, itâ€™s suited for advanced webmasters and all.</p>
<p><strong>SiteGround</strong> Hosting is actually a mixture of affordable pricing and noteworthy features. It manages to offer a bunch of freebies with the packages. For instance, you get free SSD storage, domain name, SSL certificate as well as the CDN and free Migration. Thanks to the promotions and all, SiteGround rates are quite lower.</p>
<p><strong>InMotion Hosting</strong> is a choice when you need best-in-class performance for your website. All the servers are powered by Solid State Drives. It also offers a wider variety of products, including Managed Hosting. Also, itâ€™s having strict promises about stability and pricing.</p>
<p><strong>DreamHost</strong> is also in our list of Bluehost alternatives! In addition to common hosting packages, DreamHost is also offering a bunch of cloud-based services. You get WordPress Managed Hosting and DreamCompute Cloud Servers along with the shared hosting packages. So, with DreamHost, you are going to get scalable environment for your new-gen web hosting needs.</p>
<p>So, these are the best Bluehost alternative web hosts you can go for.</p>
<h2>BluehostÂ Review â€“ The Final Word</h2>
<p>So, in our Bluehost Review, we have explored the different sections of this versatile web hosting provider! All in all, it is a worth-going-for web host you can trust. Bluehost offers optimal performance and speed on all the servers and it does not matter whether you have picked a VPS or a dedicated server. The speeds are better in Bluehost WordPress Hosting and other managed options available. Despite the features, pricing structure of Bluehost product are equally simple too. Altogether, we think you can count on Bluehost for your long-term hosting needs. In case if you still donâ€™t think that Bluehost is enough for you, you can go for any of the given alternatives.</p></div>
