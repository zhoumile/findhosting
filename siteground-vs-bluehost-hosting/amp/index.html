<div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>With enough experience in web hosting industry, both SiteGround and Bluehost are two trusted names to count on! In the course of time, they have brought several changes, making the competition tougher. So, if you happen to have a shortlist of SiteGround vs Bluehost, it’s quite hard to pick one from the duo. That having said, through section-wise comparison of both hosts, we can find the most appropriate web host from the duo. To do that, we will have to take into account several factors such as pricing, affordability, performance, uptime, reliability, features etc.</p>
<p><amp-img class="size-full wp-image-421 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/siteground-vs-bluehost.jpg" alt="SiteGround Vs Bluehost" width="700" height="440" srcset="http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/siteground-vs-bluehost.jpg 700w, http://easywaytohosting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/siteground-vs-bluehost-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"></amp-img></p>
<p>To help you pick the right one from SiteGround vs Bluehost duo, we are doing an all-round comparison of both hosts. As said, several sectors — such as affordability and hosting performance — will be taken into consideration, for sure. At the end of the comparison, you can choose well, we bet.</p>
<h2 itemprop="alternativeHeadline">A bit about SiteGround and Bluehost</h2>
<p>When compared to other prominent web hosts, SiteGround is a new player in the field. It is headquartered in Sofia, Bulgaria and started <a href="https://www.siteground.com/people">its journey back in 2004</a>. With more than 320 employees, SiteGround is offering a wide variety of web hosting services, which professionals have accepted wholeheartedly. Instead of sticking to the traditional way of hosting packages, SiteGround offers relatively-new hosting plans too. The promising fact about SiteGround is that the company was able to build a consumer-base and reputation in a relatively short time-period of around 12 years.</p>
<p>Owned by Endurance International Group, Bluehost is one of the oldest web hosting providers. It started <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/about">its journey in 1996</a> and was headquartered in Utah, USA. Later, in 2010, Bluehost was acquired by EIG —a conglomerate in web hosting industry. For a while, Bluehost was sticking onto shared hosting only. Nevertheless, in past years, Bluehost started providing different sets of hosting packages — including the traditional and newly-used ones. There is no sort of question about Bluehost’s experience and reputation in the industry.</p>
<h2>SiteGround vs Bluehost — What Do They Offer?</h2>
<p>As we said, both the companies now provide different kinds of web hosting packages, from the two categories of old and new. Still, there are slight changes, to be noted.</p>
<p>SiteGround is a company that doesn’t limit to traditional hosting packages. It, on the other hand, also focuses on the popular CMSs — WordPress and Joomla. However, taking the case of traditional hosting packages, there are four types of hosting you get. They are Shared Hosting, Cloud Hosting, Dedicated Server Hosting and Reseller Hosting. As it can be seen, there is no VPS server hosting, and it has been replaced by Cloud Hosting as the high-performance solution. In addition to these, SiteGround has dedicated sections for both WordPress and Joomla websites. You will have well-optimized web hosting for your WordPress or Joomla-powered websites; you also get WordPress &amp; Joomla themes.</p>
<p>In Bluehost catalog, you have a wider set of hosting and non-hosting products to explore! In the case of common hosting packages, you are going to have shared hosting, VPS hosting, dedicated server hosting and cloud hosting. Of course, these services are quite popular in the corresponding community of professionals. In addition to these, you can also find WordPress Hosting and WooCommerce hosting in the product list of Bluehost Hosting Services. When it is necessary to have extra care for your CMS-powered website, this can be chosen. Apart from these hosting-based products, Bluehost also offers domain names.</p>
<h2>An Idea about Pricing</h2>
<p>To get a clear idea about the pricing of SiteGround vs Bluehost duo, we will have a look on the shared hosting sector of both companies. As you know, shared hosting is the popular one among customers and many professionals find it suitable for their purpose.</p>
<p>In SiteGround, shared hosting sector has three plans — StartUp, GrowBig and GoGeek. Depending on the state of the blog/site, you can pick the appropriate plan. StartUp plan of SiteGround is priced at $3.95 per month and allows you to host single website; it’s suitable for starting websites and all. The second plan, GrowBig, has a monthly charge of $7.95 per month, offering multiple website hosting and 20 GB of storage space. It also brings premium features. The third plan in the sector is named GoGeek, which is priced at $14.95/month, which offers 30 GB of storage space and some geeky features as well. Altogether, the pricing plan of SiteGround is quite user-friendly. You get a free domain name with all plans.</p>
<p>As we come to the case of Bluehost, the prices are comparatively lower, we would say. It also has three plans in the shared hosting category — Basic, Plus and Business Pro. The basic plan, which charges you $2.95 per month (you <a href="../../bluehost-coupon-codes/index.html">get this discount if you use Bluehost coupon code</a>), is providing single-domain hosting with 50 GB of storage. By paying just $6.95, you can have the Plus plan that offers unlimited domain hosting and unlimited resources. The ultimate plan, dubbed as Business Pro, costs $14.95 per month and has unlimited resources along with high-performance aspects. Each year, you get additional stuff such as SSL, dedicated IP, SiteBackup etc. In the two other plans, you’re having just the basic hosting. A free domain name is included with all the plans.</p>
<h2>Availability of Features</h2>
<p>In the SiteGround vs Bluehost comparison, you can make a decision based on the availability of features. Unless you are ready to pay, Bluehost hosting packages don’t provide any of the features. That is, for every extra feature, you have to pay extra. However, in the case of SiteGround, there are essential features included even in the basic shared web hosting plan. The features are free domain, free SSD servers, free SSL Certificate, free daily backup, an included CloudFlare CDN, SSH and cPanel access, unlimited traffic. All these features are really helpful for most of the web-based professionals out there. In this aspect, you can choose depending on your requirement.</p>
<h2>Uptime and Performance</h2>
<p>Sadly, though, you cannot rely on uptime for selection. It’s so, because SiteGround and Bluehost offer 100% uptime, for all the hosting services available. It means that your websites will be completely functional, all the time. That is, it is not possible to decide depending on this aspect of uptime.</p>
<p>In the case of performance and speed, however, SiteGround plays the game better. As we said, SiteGround is making use of SSDs for building its server storage, which is a step towards speed and sustainable performance. In addition, it has state-of-the-art technology and infrastructure to back the services. For instance, SiteGround has its datacenters in three continents and there is SuperCacher and CDN to enhance the serving speed.</p>
<h2>Reliability and Support of SiteGround vs Bluehost</h2>
<p>As we had mentioned in the introduction, both Bluehost and SiteGround have created a good consumer-base. Along with it, you have superb money-back guarantee, in case if you’re not satisfied with the services. In terms of reliability of hosting, SiteGround and Bluehost are equal and you can choose any of them.</p>
<p>Technical Support is one section where Bluehost lags quite behind SiteGround. While SiteGround is offering support via different methods — such as live chat, ticketing system and telephone support —, Bluehost is limited to live chat only. It’s really a disadvantage because there are times when live chat becomes inadequate. Talking more about the customer support of SiteGround, it’s noted for the speed and worthiness of given support.</p>

<h3>SiteGround vs Bluehost – The Final Verdict</h3>
<p>Now that we have compared these different sections, it’s time to pick one from SiteGround vs Bluehost duo. If you’d like to an affordable host without much features, it’s okay to go with Bluehost. However, if you go with SiteGround, it is possible to have noteworthy features, such as free SSD servers, domain name, SSL certificate etc. SiteGround has better performance and speed too, not to mention the commendable uptime offered. For those who love features and extra performance, SiteGround is the appropriate choice in the duo.</p></div>
