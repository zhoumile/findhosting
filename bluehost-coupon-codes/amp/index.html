<p>Bluehost.com, as you know, is the official global platform for purchasing Bluehost products. When you purchase, sales and service are provided from the United States. Your servers will be placed in Europe or the US. and so will be the support options. This is a better option if you have a website that receives traffic from the US and other places.

<p>When it comes to Bluehost India, however, things are simple. You have an option to choose the server space – either India or US. If your website is focusing on Indian traffic, you can go for an Indian server and thus improve latency and page-load speeds. However, for global websites and app, it’s good to go with US Servers. Regardless the server location you opt, it is possible to get the benefits of Bluehost India Web Hosting. You will be able to process the payment using a native debit card or other methods. Similarly, you can get the technical support in regional languages. So, in short, you have a bunch of reasons why you should prefer Bluehost India to Bluehost.com.
